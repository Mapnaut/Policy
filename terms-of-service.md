#Mapnaut Terms of Service
We’ll try to make this as painless and straightforward as possible.

This is a contract (“Terms”) between you and _Hic Locative Media Srl_ (“Hic,“ “we,” or “us”), the company that designs, develops and publishes the _Mapnaut mobile app_ (“Mapnaut”), applicable when you use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Hic, globally, in existence now or in the future (“Hic Services”).

#These terms are a binding agreement
Even if your eyes normally glaze over the word “Terms,” it’s a good idea to read this agreement carefully before you use Mapnaut. For one thing, we want your feedback and suggestions on how to make our service better. (We’d really like to hear from you: email your input to info@mapnaut.com.) For another, by using Hic Services, you agree to be bound by everything in these Terms. If you don’t agree to the Terms, please don’t use Mapnaut.

#Your content
You own the rights to the content you post on Mapnaut. We don’t claim ownership over any of it. However, by posting or transferring content to Mapnaut, you give us permission to use your content solely to do the things we need to do to provide Hic Services, including, without limitation, storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing your content. This may include promoting your content with partner companies or services for broader broadcast, distribution, or publication.

We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.

By publishing on Mapnaut, you agree to allow others to view your content.

We don’t pre-screen user content, but we have the right (though no obligation) to refuse or remove any content you post or transfer to Hic Services for any reason.

You are free to delete your content from Mapnaut at any time, though there may be a delay in removing it from public view due to operational requirements. We may retain, but do not publicly display, backup copies of your deleted content on our servers for a reasonable amount of time before deleting it. However, If you delete your account or content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.

You’re responsible for the content you submit to Mapnaut and assume all risks associated with it, including anyone else’s reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights. By posting, you represent that you own or have the necessary rights to post the content on Mapnaut, and that doing so doesn’t conflict with any other licenses you’ve granted.

#Our content
The look and feel of Hic Services are copyright of Hic Locative Media Srl. Some portions of the Mapnaut site and the Mapnaut mobile app are licensed pursuant to third party open source licensing. For the remainder of the site and mobile app, you may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of code, logos, or visual design elements without express written permission from Hic unless otherwise permitted by law.

#We may modify these Terms at any time
We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.

You can access historical versions of our Terms of Service and other policies [here](https://github.com/Mapnaut/Policy).

#We may modify our Services at any time
We do our best to provide you a reliable and evolving service, but we may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the service, at any time, without notice. The world must keep spinning.

#Privacy
Mapnaut’s Privacy Policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Hic can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policies.

#No children please
Mapnaut is only for people 13 years old and over. If you’re under 13, we’re sorry, but you’re not allowed here. If we learn a child under 13 is using Mapnaut we will terminate the child’s account.

#Security and Responsible Disclosures
We take security very seriously, and are always on the lookout for opportunities to make our service better. If you know of any threat or breach to our security systems that we are not aware of, please email us at inof@mapnaut.com. We will do our best to restore the normal security of the service in a reasonable time.

#Third-party account use for sign-ins
We currently use third parties like Twitter to create and authorize user accounts. By using those third-party services, you agree to their terms of use, privacy policy, and other agreements between you and them.

#Our rules
Because Mapnaut is a shared space, and we want many different ideas to thrive, we need to have a few ground rules. There aren’t many. In fact, they can pretty much all be summed up thusly: Don’t pee in the pool (metaphorically speaking).

These are our rules:
- You shall not use the Service in connection with any violation of any applicable law or regulation;
- you shall not use the Service to engage in any illegal conduct or for any unauthorized purpose;
- you shall not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, sell or use in whatever way the contents of the Service;
- you shall not use automation software, bots, hacks, mods or any unauthorized third-party software designed to modify or interfere with the Service;
- you cannot modify, adapt or hack the Service or modify another website as to falsely imply that it is associated with Mapnaut;
- you shall not modify or cause to be modified any files that are a part of the Service;
- you must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature;
- you shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or to other users’ accounts;
- you must ensure that the password you received for your access is kept secret. 
- you must not crawl, scrape, or otherwise cache any content from Mapnaut, including but not limited to users profile and photo;
- you shall not use the Service to share any material or information that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, right of privacy, right of publicity, or other right of any person or entity;

Failure to comply with these rules may result in us taking action such as removing content, or suspending or deleting your account.

#INTERLUDE
You’re doing great, Dear Reader of these Terms. Let’s rest a moment, shall we? You’ve earned it. So far, so good, right? Everything pretty clear? Well, don’t get too comfortable. Now’s the time to activate the full Galactic Armada of your legal vocabulary comprehension and ALL CAPS READING SKILLS. What follows are several sections of heavily lawyered-up provisions that we would love to express in a more human-readable, less legal manner. But their form and substance has evolved over time, often via brutal, hand-to-hand litigation or not-to-be-ignored authoritative rulings from courts and interpretations by agencies. This gives us little flexibility in the wording, at least if we want to avoid being laughed out of court in some Doomsday scenario that neither of us even wants to think about. So these following provisions are important, you should read them carefully, and we apologize for the excruciating lawyerly patois.

Miscellaneous lawyerly provisions (please read these carefully)
1. YOU USE THE HIC SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

2. MAPNAUT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO HIC SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT (I) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, ABSOLUTELY SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (III) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, OR (IV) ANY ERRORS IN THE HIC SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.

3. YOU UNDERSTAND AND EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT HIC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF HIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; (V) OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE HIC SERVICES.

4. THE FAILURE OF HIC TO EXERCISE OR ENFORCE ANY RIGHT OR PROVISION OF THESE TERMS SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THAT RIGHT OR PROVISION. THE TERMS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND HIC AND GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE HIC SERVICES, SUPERSEDING ANY PRIOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN YOU AND HIC (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE TERMS). YOU AGREE THAT THESE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE HIC SERVICES ARE GOVERNED UNDER THE ITALIAN LAW. BEFORE RESORTING TO COURTS, WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTACT US DIRECTLY TO TRY TO WORK IT OUT.

We’d love to hear your questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy. If you have any suggestions for us, feel free to let us know at info@mapnaut.com.

The End.
