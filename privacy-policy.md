#Mapnaut Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 6-01-14

Privacy is important. We respect yours.

#General information	
This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Hic Locative Media Srl, in existence now or in the future (“Hic Services”). Please read it carefully.

#What we may collect
We collect information about what content you access or visit, information about your mobile device (such as device or browser type), information volunteered by you (such as through registration), the URLs of websites that referred you to us, and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via email.

If you allow the mobile application to do so, Mapnaut will collect your geographical location each time you access the app, save or re-save a placemark and perform a search query, together with the respective date. You can enable/disable this option by accessing your device’s settings. Please be aware that if you disable the geolocalization feature, your position will not be stored but most functionalities of Mapnaut will be compromised.

When you log into Hic Services or load a web page from Hic Services, we collect and store your Internet Protocol address. We may use this information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; to personalize Hic Services for you; or to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Hic Services.

When you create your Mapnaut account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter, we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that third-party account, so that we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who are also on Mapnaut.

#Email communications with us
We may occasionally need to email you some administrative info, tell you something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. In really tough situations, like when we got dumped that one time, we might just need to vent about how unfair life is. Except for that last scenario, which won’t actually happen, these administrative communications are considered a basic part of Hic Services, and you may not be able to opt out from receiving them. You can always opt out of non-administrative emails.

We will never email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, send it to us so we can take action against the evildoer.

#Disclosure of your information
The information we collect is used to provide and improve Hic Services and content and prevent abuse. We don’t sell personal information about our users to any third party.

While Hic endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we’re going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with advance notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.

We may disclose your information without providing you with prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. In that case, we will endeavor to provide you with post-disclosure notice when permitted by law.

We will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.

If we’re acquired by or merged with another company and your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.

#Public user content
Mapnaut is meant for publishing public, not private, content. By default, whatever you share through Hic Services is public. Even if you chose not to public your content to third-party services such as Twitter, you should assume that any content you provide us may become publicly accessible.

Content published and shared through Hic Services is publicly accessible, which means that everyone, including search engines, will be able to see it. This content may also be copied and shared by others throughout the Internet, including through features native to Hic Services, such as saving and re-saving a placemark.

You are free to remove published content from your account, or even disable your account entirely. However, because of the  strong possibility that others will re-save your content, and technological limitations inherent to Hic Services, copies of your content may exist elsewhere indefinitely, including in our systems.

#Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of text, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website.

We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Hic Services. We use cookies to identify whether you have logged in and recognize that your web browser has accessed aspects of Hic Services, and we may associate that information with your account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on Hic Services when you are logged in. To measure the deliverability of our emails to users, we may embed information in them, such as a web beacon or tag.

Some third-party services that we use may place their own cookies in your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

#Data Storage
Mapnaut uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Heroku, to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Mapnaut. Although Mapnaut owns its code, databases, and all rights to the Mapnaut application, you retain all rights to your content.

We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. This means that after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

#Data security
We use encryption methods to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as keeping your password secret).

#Children
Hic Services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under 13. We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at info@mapnaut.com. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.

#Changes to this Policy
Mapnaut may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes by placing a prominent notice on our site before the changes take effect.

The most current version of the policy will always be on this page and we will archive former versions of the policy [here](https://github.com/Mapnaut/Policy).

#Questions
We welcome questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy. If you have any suggestions for us, feel free to let us know at info@mapnaut.com.
